# JStore
JStore is a distributed key-value store built in C++17

## Planning
JStore is built incrementally. The current stage of development is a **single node, in-memory KV-store with WAL persistence**. Below are the deliverables for the current stage:

**Database internal**
-[] Memtable definition
-[] Memtable instruction interface

**Persistence**
-[] WAL definition
-[] WAL instruction parser
-[] WAL instruction executor/replay

**User-level interface**
-[] REPL
-[] exact-match querying interface
